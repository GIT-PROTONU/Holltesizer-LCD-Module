# Holltesizer-LCD-Module
Arduino and accompanying Processing code to get the currently selected Scene and Track in Ableton Live 10 on a LCD display.

Works by having a Processing program talk to Ableton 10 using the OSC message protocol to view the data on a 16 character display driven by an Arduino Uno. The two are connected using a serial port and the OSC protocol withing Processing is handeld by the [OSCP5 Library from Andreas](http://example.com){:target="_blank"} OSCP5 Library from Andreas, thanks on you mate!
